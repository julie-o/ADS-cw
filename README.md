# Coursework - Advanced Database Systems INFR11217

<hr>

<p>In this assignment, you will implement the minimization procedure for conjunctive queries
and a lightweight database engine for evaluating queries called Minibase.</p>

<p>The goals of this assignment are threefold:</p>
<ol><li>to understand the minimization procedure for conjunctive queries,</li>
    <li>to teach you how to translate conjunctive queries into relational algebra query plans,</li>
    <li>to learn the iterator model for relational operator evaluation and implement the most 
    common operators (e.g., selection, projection, join, aggregation).</li>
</ol>

<p>The assignment consists of three tasks:<br>
Task 1 (30%): Implementation of the minimization procedure for conjunctive queries.<br>
Task 2 (40%): Implementation of the iterator model and common RA operators.<br>
Task 3 (20%): Optimisation of constructed query plans.
</p>
